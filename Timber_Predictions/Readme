This project uses simple linear regression to predict the volume of timber
that can be harvested from a black cherry tree given its girth and height. 
The online prediction application (https://mhthom2.shinyapps.io/FinalProject/)
allows the user to input tree girth in inches and height in feet, 
and outputs the predicted volume of timber in cubic feet. 
It also includes a 3D display of the training data and the prediction. 
The project also includes a presentation with embedded R code that includes 
A 3D display of the training data. 

The project was completed in R using the 'plotly' and 'shiny' packages.
