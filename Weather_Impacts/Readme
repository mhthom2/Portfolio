Using the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s storm database, which tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, I analyzed the public health and economic impacts of severe weather from 1950 and to the end in November 2011. From these data, I found that tornadoes by far caused the most fatalities and injuries, but that the cold and wind chill had the highest fatality rate. For economic impacts, I measured the total property and crop damages of a weather event. Tornadoes again had by far the highest impact. 

The report was completed in R markdown with embedded code using the 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', 'stringr', and 'reshape2' packages.
