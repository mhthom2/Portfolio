For this project, I was given a data set consisting of 21,693 banking 
transactions, and I was tasked with creating a classifier that could 
detect which new transactions are fraudulent. Each transaction included 
22 unlabeled attributes, an amount, and a class. From the data, 
I was able to create SVM and Logistic Regression classifiers, but the 
results were mixed. 

The classifiers were created in Python using the pandas, seaborn, matplotlib,
and sklearn. 

The data set isn't available for download, but I can share it upon request.
