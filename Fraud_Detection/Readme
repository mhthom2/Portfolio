For this project, I was given a data set consisting of 21,693 banking transactions, and I created a classifier that could detect which new transactions are fraudulent. Each transaction included 22 unlabeled numeric attributes, a floating point amount, and a class. From the data, I was able to create SVM and Logistic Regression classifiers, but the results were mixed. 

The classifiers were created in Python using the 'pandas', 'seaborn', 'matplotlib', and 'sklearn' libraries. 

The data set isn't available for download, but I can share it upon request.
