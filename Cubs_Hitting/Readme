The Chicago Cubs are a Major League Baseball (MLB) team. 
Because the Cubs play about 44% of their games during the day, 
an analyst might expect their players to perform well during the day. 
And according to my exploratory analysis of the 2023 season (see PDF), 
using the team's batting average, on-base percentage plus slugging percentage, 
and just slugging percentage, the team seemed to perform worse during the day. 
However, using hypothesis testing (see Jupyter notebook), 
the batting averages for the daytime were greater than or equal to 
the averages at night. 

This analysis was done in Python using the pandas, numpy, scipy, and 
seaborn libraries. 

The data was compiled on the Stathead web site and is available at these
