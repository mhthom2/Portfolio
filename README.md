# Portfolio
This repository contains projects that I finished while completing the Johns Hopkins Data Science certification, which includes ten courses using R, and the University of Michigan Applied Data Science certification, which consists of five courses using Jupyter notebooks. 

## R Programming Projects: 
Ambient_Air_Pollutants
Automobile_Transmissions
Civil_War_Map
Exercise_Classifier
Timber_Predictions
Tooth_Classifier
Weather_Impacts

## Python Programming with Jupyter Notebooks Projects:
[Cubs_Hitting](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Cubs_Hitting)
* Analyzed Chicago Cubs hitting during day vs at night
* Performed hypothesis testing to compare performance
  
[Fraud_Detection](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Fraud_Detection)
* Built classifiers to detect fraudulent bank tranactions
* Created Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression classifiers
* Used cross validation to fine tune hyper-parameters
* Evaluated models according to accuracy, precision, recall

[Network_Analysis](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Network_Analysis)
* Used 'networkx' library to analyzed networks
* Studied the connectedness of an email network
* Rated the sites in a blog network  

[Text_Analysis](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Text_Analysis)
* Performed exploratory analysis on plot summaries
* Built three spelling recommenders
    - Based two recommenders on Jaccard similarity and n-grams
    - Created third recommender using edit distance of tokens   

[Viewer_Engagement](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Viewer_Engagement)
* Created several machine learning models to classify user engagement with educational videos
* Performed cross validation to determine best combination of hyper-parameters
* Used F-1 score to evaluate classifiers
