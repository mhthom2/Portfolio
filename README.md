# Portfolio
This repository contains projects that I finished while completing the Johns Hopkins Data Science certification, which includes ten courses using R, and the University of Michigan Applied Data Science certification, which consists of five courses using Jupyter notebooks. 

## R Programming Projects: 
[Ambient_Air_Pollutants](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Ambient_Air_Pollutants)
* Performed analysis of fine particulate pollutants in the US
* Used the 'gglot2' library to visualize trends in the data 

[Automobile_Transmissions](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Automobile_Transmissions)
* Compared fuel economy of cars with automatic transmissions and manual transmissions
* Performed hypothesis testing to show automatice transmissions are more fuel efficient

[Civil_War_Map](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Civil_War_Map)
* Created interactive map of the major battles of the US Civil War 
* Using 'leaflet' library, located flag icons for victor and provide link to Wikipedia page of battles 

[Exercise_Classifier](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Exercise_Classifier)
* Built several multi-class classifiers to rate the quality a given exercise  
* Stacked best-performing models to improve accuracy of the results 

[Timber_Predictions](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Timber_Predictions)
* Created Shiny application that predicts cherry tree timber volume given its height and girth
* Using 'plotly' library, presented 3D visualization of training data  

[Tooth_Classifier](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Tooth_Classifier)
* Determined best dosage and vitamin C supplement using hypothesis testing 
* Performed exploratory analysis with 'ggplot2' visualization tools 

[Weather_Impacts](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Weather_Impacts)
* Combined data sets to study public health and economic impacts of severe weather
* Used 'ggplot2' library to presented results 

## Python Programming with Jupyter Notebooks Projects:
[Cubs_Hitting](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Cubs_Hitting)
* Analyzed Chicago Cubs hitting during day vs at night
* Performed hypothesis testing to show no difference in the hitting results
  
[Fraud_Detection](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Fraud_Detection)
* Built classifiers to detect fraudulent bank tranactions
* Created Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression classifiers
* Used cross validation to fine tune hyper-parameters
* Evaluated models according to accuracy, precision, recall

[Network_Analysis](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Network_Analysis)
* Used 'networkx' library to analyzed networks
* Studied the connectedness of an email network
* Rated the sites in a blog network  

[Text_Analysis](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Text_Analysis)
* Performed exploratory analysis on plot summaries
* Built three spelling recommenders
    - Based two recommenders on Jaccard similarity and n-grams
    - Created third recommender using edit distance of tokens   

[Viewer_Engagement](https://github.com/mhthom2/Portfolio/tree/main/Viewer_Engagement)
* Created several machine learning models to classify user engagement with educational videos
* Performed cross validation to determine best combination of hyper-parameters
* Used F-1 score to evaluate classifiers
