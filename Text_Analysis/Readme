For this project, I used the 'nltk' library to explore 
the CMU Movie Summary Corpus. 
All data is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License. 

I also created three spelling recommenders that uses the 'nltk' library 
to find words similar to the misspelling. Two of the recommenders used 
the Jaccard Similarity index and n-grams to correct the misspelled words. 
The edit distance metric with transposition was used in the other recommender. 

In addition to the 'nltk' library, the project uses the 'pandas', 'numpy', 
and 'collections' libraries.
