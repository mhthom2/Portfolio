This project displays the locations of the major battles of the US Civil War (1861-65). The flag icons indicate which army was the victor for that battle, 
and the embedded links connect to Wikipedia web sites about the battle.

The interactive HTML page was created using R markdown using the 'dplyr' and 'Leaflet' packages.
