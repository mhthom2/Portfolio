For this project, I analyzed how the dosage and delivery method of vitamin C
impacted the growth of guinea pig odontoblasts, cells responsible for tooth
growth. Each animal received one of three dose levels of 
vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice 
or ascorbic acid, a form of vitamin C. Using hypothesis testing, I determined 
that the 2 mg/day dosage increased tooth growth the most, and that the 
type of supplement didn't impact the results. 

The report was completed using R markdown with embedded code using the 'dplyr'
and 'ggplot2' packages. 

The analysis was done on the R 'tooth' data set.
