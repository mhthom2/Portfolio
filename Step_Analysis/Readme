For this project I analyzed data collected from a personal activity 
monitoring device, like a Fitbit. The device collected data at 5 minute 
intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data 
from an anonymous individual.

I used R markdown with embedded code using the 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', and 
'cowplot' to complete the exploratory analysis.


The data can be downloaded from this url:
