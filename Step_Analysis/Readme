For this project I analyzed data collected from a personal activity monitoring device, like a Fitbit. The device collected the number of steps taken by an anonymous individual in 5 minute intervals each day over two months.

I used R markdown with embedded code using the 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', and 'cowplot' to complete the exploratory analysis.

The data can be downloaded from this url:
