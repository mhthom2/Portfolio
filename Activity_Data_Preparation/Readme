For this project, I cleaned and prepared a data set contains experimental data collected by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and Luca Oneto at the Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory. The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed one of six activities while wearing a smartphone on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity.

Data clean-up and preparation included reading in the data from text files in a non-standard format, isolating mean and standard deviation values, and 
creating descriptive labels for the attribute labels. I then summarized this data in a codebook. I also calculated the mean of each of these attributes 
and summarized those values in another codebook.

This project was done in R using the 'dplyr', 'readr', and 'stringr' packages. I also used the 'dataMaid' package to create the codebooks.
