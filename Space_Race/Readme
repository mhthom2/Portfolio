For this project, the Capstone for my IBM Data Science certification, I took the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company, Space Y. My job was to determine the price of each future rocket launch for the company. I did this by gathering information about SpaceX and creating dashboards for my team. I also determined if SpaceX would be able to reuse the first stage of their rockets. 

Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I trained a machine learning model and used web-scraped public information to make predictions about their successful launches. 

This project was completed using Python with the 'pandas', 'numpy', 'matplotlib', 'plotly', 'folium', 'sqlite', 'seaborn', and 'sklearn' libraries.
