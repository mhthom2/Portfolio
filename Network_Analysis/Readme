'networkx' is a Python library used for the creation, manipulation, and analysis of complex networks. I used this library look at two different types of networks: the email network of a mid-sized company and a network of political blog sites. 

In addition to the 'networkx' library, I used the 'pandas' and 'operator' libraries for this project. 

The data for this project isn't available for download, but I can supply it upon request.
