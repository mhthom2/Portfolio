One critical property of a successful video is engagement: 
how interesting it is for viewers. Engagement is critical for learning. 
For this project, I created classifiers that predict how engaging an 
educational video is likely to be for viewers. 

I created classifiers using Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, 
Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models. Using 
F-1 scoring because of the class imbalance of the data, I found that the 
tree-based models performed best. 

For this Python project, I used the 'pandas', 'numpy', 'matplotlib', and 
'sklearn' libraries.
